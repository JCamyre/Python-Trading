Don't forget about couple day old penny stocks, can either get a dip buy or they may just go up the next day lol
Be more willing to trade stocks that you sold once
An alert for when a stock moves a lot is needed only needs to move about 5%
Also listen to how the Warrior Trading guy talks about stuff
