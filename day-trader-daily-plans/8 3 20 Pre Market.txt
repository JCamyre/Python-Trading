Do the "9 2" strat (aka the 929 strat) for the first couple hours, then be even more cautious
Can maybe greed in the first 30 mins, but still very risky
Do this until penny stocks start double bouncing again (after the first couple hours)
Current market sentiment is shorting penny stocks and not allowing second balance

PRPO example of buying day 3 of penny stock: able to hold the new support level (7/30/20 - 8/3/20)

Only use the 929 strat when 9 SMA in uptrend?

$CAN?

Have an open mind, no emotions. If see the patterns, do it.
